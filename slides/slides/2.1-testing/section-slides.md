# Testing Principles

---

# Testing WHAT?

Different Targets

<v-click>

1. 📃 **Code**

        (e.g. it doesn't break)

</v-click>
<v-click>

2. 💼 **Requirements**

        (e.g. business is happy)

</v-click>
<v-click>

3. 🖥 **Environments**

        (e.g. deployment to prod works!)

</v-click>
<v-click>

4. 📚 **Data**

        (e.g. dataset is statistically reasonable)

</v-click>

<!--

1. Is code getting slower? is memory usage worse? is coverage good enough? public interface respected?
2. Is code doing what is expected from it?
3. Code is fine, business is happy, but will this work when deployed in production?
4. Statistical testing for datasets

-->

# WHY bother testing?

3 Reasons

<v-click>

1. 🐞 To catch **bugs**

        (proves existence, not lack thereof!)

</v-click>
<v-click>

2. 🧑‍💻 To increase developer **confidence**

        (promotes refactoring, hence clean code)

</v-click>
<v-click>

3. 💡 To **share understanding** among engineering team

        (becomes a form of living documentation)

</v-click>

<!--
Understanding your testing suite keeps you connected to your business. Becomes critical in times of "AI vibe coding".

# Testing HOW?

Empirically

Unlike **Static Analysis** and **Formal Verification** approaches...

... testing is more **EMPIRICAL** and less **FORMAL**.

[https://se.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications/testing/principles.pdf](https://se.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications/testing/principles.pdf)

<v-click>

        - Business wants to stop spending, regardless of testing

        - The value of testing ∝ The value of the project

</v-click>

---

# Testing HOW?

Automatically

<v-click>

If testing is informal ...

Manual testing is savage *

</v-click>

---

# Testing HOW?

Pragmatically

# Testing Concepts

---

# Testing **Work-flow**

- The **Test Driver**

- The **Feedback Loop**


---

# Test Driver

(Testing Work-flow)

The process driving the testing framework could be ...

<Transform :scale="0.8">

<v-click>

- `python custom_testing_logic.py`

        - A tailored custom python process, legacy, not cool anymore

</v-click>
<v-click>

- `pytest`

        - Works like a charm, specially from PyCharm

</v-click>
<v-click>

- `nox`

        - Multi-python-environment testing

</v-click>
<v-click>

- `containerized shell`

        - Multi-environment testing

</v-click>
<v-click>

- `ci/cd`

        - Already vendor-tainted

</v-click>

</Transform>

---

# Feedback Loop

(Testing Work-flow)

For each new test for a new feature (or bugfix)...


```mermaid
stateDiagram
    direction LR
    classDef testPass color:green,stroke-width:2px
    classDef testFail color:red,stroke-width:2px

    [*] --> pass_tests:::testPass : git pull
    pass_tests --> fail_new:::testFail : implement new test
    fail_new --> pass_new:::testPass : implement new code
    pass_new --> pass_tests_again:::testPass
    pass_new --> pass_new_again:::testPass : (optional) refactor code and/or test
    pass_new_again --> fail_new_again:::testFail : comment implementation
    fail_new_again --> pass_tests_again:::testPass : uncomment implementation
    pass_tests_again --> [*] : git push
```

<v-click>

        - ensure you start (and finish) your work from a passing state

</v-click>
<v-click>

        - see your new test fail!

</v-click>
<v-click>

        - specially if you refactored!

</v-click>

<v-click>

        - your CI/CD pipeline should run the rest of your test suite

</v-click>


<!--

save the planet! run locally first, leverage git hooks

should state diagram invert state / transition elements?

# Testing **Frameworks**

1. **[doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html)**

        - nice for python coding interviews ;)

2. **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)**

        - great python builtin

3. **[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/index.html)**

        - makes testing fun again

</v-click>

# pytest Exercise

Assertions and Fixtures

*Search help at https://docs.pytest.org*

1. Write a test with asserts for `is_even` function of `core.py`
1. Implement the tests for `multiply`, fix bugs as needed but see the test fail!
1. Implement tests for `divide` using `pytest.raises`. Test for error message too.
TODO
1. Add a fixture to your test to factor out your test data
1. Move your fixture to `conftest.py` so it can be reused later
1. Add a docstring to your fixture and see the docs with `pytest --fixtures`

---

# Parametrization

1 test * N input combinations = N tests

<v-click>

Your test becomes a function and its parametrized invocations become test instances.

</v-click>
<v-click>

Removes duplication while promoting dynamic test-case generation.

</v-click>
<v-click>

*Example from Numpy @ https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v2.2.3/numpy/distutils/tests/test_log.py#L23*

# Parametrization

<Transform :scale="0.5">

![fuzzing](./assets/fuzzing.jpg)

</Transform>

<!--

Introducing Fuzzing requires a workflow adjustment and a more complex setup.

Randomized input testing proved to be quite efficient.

These days used a lot in security context for vulnerability checking within penetration testing.

-->

# Mocking

(Testing Features)


<v-click>

The **Mock** is the object you replace a real one with to inspect in your test

</v-click>
<v-click>

The **Stub** is the callable you repleace a real function with to prevent being called from your test

</v-click>
<v-click>

**Patching** is the action of "implanting" the mock/stub

</v-click>
<v-click>

`monkeypatch` is the pytest fixture for patching and mocking.

</v-click>

---

# Mocking

Pytest Example

```
def test_getssh(monkeypatch):
    # mocked return function to replace Path.home
    # always return '/abc'
    def mockreturn():
        return Path("/abc")

    # Application of the monkeypatch to replace Path.home
    # with the behavior of mockreturn defined above.
    monkeypatch.setattr(Path, "home", mockreturn)

    # Calling getssh() will use mockreturn in place of Path.home
    # for this test with the monkeypatch.
    x = getssh()
    assert x == Path("/abc/.ssh")
```

More examples in https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/monkeypatch.html

# pytest Exercise

Parametrization and Mocking

1. use `pytest.mark.parametrize` in `test_count_vowels` to change one test with multiple asserts into multiple tests with one assert each. Run and see the output.

1. Write a test in `test_app.py` that mocks `os.getenv` and makes the function using `os.getenv` fail

# Testing Practices

---

# Common Pitfalls

<v-click>

1. tests < CODE ?

        (tests hold so much value!)

</v-click>
<v-click>

2. integrat**ING** tests

        (don't couple or share state among tests)

</v-click>
<v-click>

3. failed to see the test fail

        (green is cool but have you seen red?)

</v-click>

---

# Good Habits


<v-click>

1. Adjust your code for testability

        (e.g. dependency injection, flags)

</v-click>
<v-click>

2. Keep your tests focused, decoupled and organized

        (e.g. order and functional independence)

</v-click>
<v-click>

3. Tailor your testing workflow

        (e.g. easy to run for first contributors, fast feedback loops,
        unit-tests as default, pre-push hooks, etc.)

</v-click>
